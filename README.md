Rich Roblox studio in the browser

This project was created to get Roblox Studio running on almost all devices that support the web.

This project is also <b>highly</b> dependent on javascript.

This project isn't <b>finished</b>, there are still important features that are missing

Currently has following features:
* Full login Roblox login account system with captcha


<b>IMPORTANT:</b> This process requires you to log in with a password and unless you're hosting this locally, I <b>highly</b> recommend you create an alternative account on ROBLOX.COM and log in with that.
I don't store your password but other people who host this could, don't enter your real password into this unless you are sure it doesn't store your password.


* THREE.JS WebGL rendering for Roblox studio objects with camera movement

* Full explorer and script editor

* Ability to run your game, recieve logs back, and have a live view of it running

* Game explorer with thumbnails


This project isn't meant to replace Roblox Studio it is just a way to use it with unsupported devices.
